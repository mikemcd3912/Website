            <p class="card-text">After beginning my career in Accounting and earning my CPA, I found that my favorite part of my work was 
                building tools for the teams I worked on, teaching people how to use technology in a more clever or efficient way, to save everyone 
                time and make the team's work go more smoothly. When I considered my career path and where I wanted to develop my skills I came to the conclusion 
                while at EY that I didn't want to continue on to my scheduled advancement to Senior Accountant. I decided to transition into a
                role that would provide me more time to explore computer science, while still allowing me to pay my way through school. In
                    the fall of 2019, I joined Zillow's Corporate accounting team and began taking computer science classes on my nights
                    and weekends. I loved the new challenge and was really interested in learning more, so after two community college courses I 
                    found the OSU Post-Baccaulaureate program and began my career path transition.

            <p class="card-text">Now I have returned to school full time to commit to the transition into Computer Science and focus my attention on learning the 
            skills I will need on my new path. If I sound like a good fit for your team, please don't hesitate to reach out! I am actively looking for a Winter  
            or Summer 2021 Internship, or Full time position for after I graduate in August 2021.
