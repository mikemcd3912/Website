                    wanted to create a site that could provide additional detail into some of my projects, centralize contant information as well as provide a location for a possible
                    employer to get to know me better. The site will be updated with new projects from time to time as I complete more complex work and refine my skills!`</p>

                <h3>Content Generator Microservice</h3>
                <p class="card-text">This project was made in connection with my Software Engineering I class for OSU, in which we learned about creating a GUI with cognitive style
                    hueristics in mind, using an Agile/Scrum development cycle to do rolling releases to the functionality, and practice how to research and use third
                    party libraries. The project was structured as a Microservice, with the requirement that our service would both call to another classmate's service
                    for data to consume, as well as be available for another Microservice to call upon for data to use. My project was a "Content Generator", which would accept
                    Keywords through the Graphical user interface or a .csv file, and scrape wikipedia for a paragraph relating to those keywords. For my interaction with another 
                    Microservice, I also created functionality with a classmate's service that provided amazon shopping results to show top 10 related products for
                    the provided keywords. To implement this, I utilized the BeautifulSoup library for web-scraping, the Tkinter library for the GUI, and the subprocess library
                    for running the classmate's microservice to produce the shopping results with my keyword inputs</p>

                <p class="card-text">This project was a Full stack website I created with Brittany Leggett in the Introduction to Databases class 
                    from my degree program. The site included a Node.js server running on an AWS EC2 instance, front end functionality for creating 
                    user accounts that were stored in the database, display and filtering of motorcycle ride database values as well as the ability 
                    to log in as an administrator to perform Create/Update/Delete functionalities for the tables in the database. We shared responsibility 
                    for bth the front end and back end, with the majority of my work focusing on back end functionality and database interactions.</p>
