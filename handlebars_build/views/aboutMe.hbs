            <p class="bg-light">I've always had an interest in building things, fixing things and learning how things work. In my free time this has 
                translated into a passion for anything technical. I always find myself drawn to learning more about how things work and how I can improve 
                them. While this began with an interest in bikes at a young age and evolved into cars and motorcycles as I got older, I recently learned 
                that with programming I can create things without needing the budget or space for a project vehicle and parts. In one of my projects, I started 
                to delve into  
            </p>
            <p class="bg-light pt-2">After beginning my career in Accounting and earning my CPA, I found that my favorite part of my work was 
                building tools for the teams I worked on, teaching people how to use technology in a more clever or efficient way, to save everyone 
                time and make the team's work go more smoothly. When I considered my career path and where I wanted to develop my skills I came to the conclusion 
                 while at EY that I didn't want to continue on to my scheduled advancement to Senior Accountant. I decided to transition into a
                  role that would provide me more time to explore computer science, while still allowing me to pay my way through school. In
                   the fall of 2019, I joined Zillow's Corporate accounting team and began taking computer science classes on my nights
                    and weekends. I loved the new challenge and was really interested in learning more, so after two community college courses I 
                    found the OSU Post-Baccaulaureate program and began my career path transition.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-light pt-2">Now in 2021, I have returned to school full time 
                    to commit to the transition into Computer Science and focus my attention on learning the skills I will need on my new path. If I
                     sound like a good fit for your team, please don't hesitate to reach out! I am actively looking for a Winter or Summer 2021 Internship, 
                     or Full time position for after I graduate in August 2021.
